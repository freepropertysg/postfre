<h2>About PostFre</h2>
<p>
PostFre is derived from <strong>“post”</strong> and <strong>“fre.”</strong> The term <strong>“fre”</strong> represents <em>freely</em> and <em>freedom</em>, expressing the idea of posting without restriction by category, niche or location. Built as an open, global posting platform, PostFre allows individuals and businesses to share listings across multiple categories and regions in one place.
